- export JIF to PATH 

** To export one directory while the actual session is active
	export PATH=$PATH:/home/estudiante/jif-3.4.2/bin/

** To permanently export one directory to your enviroment variable $PATH, add the following sentence to ~/.bashrc file end:
	export PATH=$PATH:/home/estudiante/jif-3.4.2/bin/

- Setup the enviroment directory:

This script compiles with jif compiler the principals requires for your jif project, that you put in the jif-src/jif/principals/ directory. Eg Alice.jif, Bob.jif

- compile with Jif compiler your code jif --> jifc.sh:
	 ./jifc.sh -e jif-src/T/T.jif 

-run the program generated
	./jif.sh yourProgram
