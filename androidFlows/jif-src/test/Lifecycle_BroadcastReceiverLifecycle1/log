    Label Descriptions
    ------------------
     - pc = label of the program counter at this call site
     - pc = {_->_; _<-_ ⊔ context}
     - callee_PC_bound = lower bound on the side effects of the method public
     static native test.SmsManager getDefault()
     - callee_PC_bound = {Alice->}
     - context = polymorphic label of formal argument context of method 
    onReceive (bounded above by {*->})
     - this = label of the special variable "this" in test.TestReceiver
     - caller_pc = The pc at the call site of this method (bounded above by 
    {})

    Calling the method at this program point may reveal too much information 
    to the receiver of the method call. public static native test.SmsManager 
    getDefault() can only be invoked if the invocation will reveal no more 
    information than the callee's begin label, callee_PC_bound. However, 
    execution reaching this program point may depend on information up to the
     PC at this program point: pc.
                SmsManager sms = SmsManager.getDefault();
                                 ^---------------------^
