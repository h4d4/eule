    Label Descriptions
    ------------------
     - rhs.nv = label of successful evaluation of right hand of assignment
     - rhs.nv = {Alice->; _<-_ ⊔ caller_pc ⊔ this}
     - label of field passwordCorrect = {}
     - caller_pc = The pc at the call site of this method (bounded above by 
    {})
     - this = label of the special variable "this" in test.ImplicitFlow2

    More information is revealed by the successful evaluation of the right 
    hand side of the assignment than is allowed to flow to the field 
    passwordCorrect.
        if (userInputPassword.equals("superSecure")) passwordCorrect = true;
